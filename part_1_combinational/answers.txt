3.  Shifters

>> Dynamic: the system requires 16 selectors with size = 16, driven by the shftAmnt. 
Every selector is connected to all the elements(words) of the vector in different input.

>> Costant: there is no need for selectors.

>> Using a barrel shifter we increase the length of the critical path but we require only log2(16) = 4 selectors with size = 2.
We combine the selectors with log2(16) costant shifters that do not require selectors.
